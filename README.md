# Web services SOAP, WSDL with JAXWS
This project aims to deploy a service (a bank service in this example) on JaxWS server. As a web service, we have a bunch of operations applied on accounts in a bank.

### Web service : server 

![Bank Service](https://github.com/loubnaAminou/SOAPWebService/blob/main/imgs/bankservice.png)

In this case, we will publish the service as and endpoint thanks to Jakarta XML web service (JAXWS). And talking about web service, it is consumed not only locally, but no matter the IP address that's why we will use 0.0.0.0 instead of localhost.

As a result, we have the WSDL generated by the serve in order to check the operations of the web service

![WSDL](https://github.com/loubnaAminou/SOAPWebService/blob/main/imgs/wsdl.png)

The web service is created, and now it's the time to test it using the SOAP UI. The test is generally based on the WSDL generated works as an endpoint of the WS.

At this point, we could assume that the bank web service worked 100%.

### Create a Java client : consumer
Before starting, we have to generate Java code from the WSDL using a plugin provided by intelliJ. And then, all the operation are generated and the web service is ready to be consumed.

Now, we create a Java class as a client. This client will use the service as if it is running locally and manipulate the methods easily.

By that, the execution is successfully finished with no error.
